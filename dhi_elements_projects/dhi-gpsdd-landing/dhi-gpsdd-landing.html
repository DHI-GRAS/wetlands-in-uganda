                <h3>Project introduction</h3>
                The objective of this project is to explore the potential of earth observation (EO) satellite data for taking stock of and monitoring wetlands, a vital component of the global water resources ecosystem. This activity will pilot design and development of a user friendly digital system for use by the Ugandan Ministry of Water and Environment, to enable national authorities to generate spatial time series statistical data for taking inventory and monitoring national wetland resources train the government on its use and produce a roadmap for scaling to other countries of East Africa. This is a unique attempt to demonstrate the potential of satellite-derived EO data to provide a full national wetland inventory in Uganda, which has been a pilot country for monitoring of SDG Target 6.6.

                The project is funded by the <a href="http://www.data4sdgs.org/" target="_blank">Global Partnership on Sustainable Development Data (GPSDD)</a> with support from the World Bank's Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building (TFSCB)

                <h3>This site is currently a PROTOTYPE</h3>
                This website is a prototype, also containing prototype data which has not been validated yet. Hence current data does not reflect actual wetland extents with any confidence. In it's current state, the site only works as a demonstration of how the site will function at the end of the project.
                <br><br>
                The latest version of the map can be downloaded here <a href="http://grasdemo.dhigroup.com/download/Uganda_wetland_probability.zip">Uganda Wetland map v 2018-09-10</a>
                <br><br>
                <h3>Site contents</h3>
                This website helps users to know more about the wetland coverage and its change over a period of time using satellite imagery and data.<br>
                <br>
                The page contains the following data:
                <ul>
                    <li>Wetlands map for 2017 (prototype)</li>
                    <li>Wetlands map for 2018 (non valid-data - only for demonstration of multiple timesteps)</li>
                    <li>S2 cloud free mosaic (background imagery for reference)</li>
                    <li>Google Maps background map (for reference)</li>
                </ul>
                Additionally, the site requires you to select the level you want to explore statistics on. E.g. do you want to see country-scale, regional or district-scale statistics. After selecting the scale, just click on the area you want to see statistics for and the statistics will be displayed on the right hand side. Current statistics only includes the areas covered by the protoype map and hence only part of the country.
